# PassForge â€“ Password Generator and Strength Checker

This is the starting point for a Chrome/Edge extension called **PassForge**.  
The goal: a simple, privacy-first tool that helps users generate strong passwords and check their strength directly in the browser.

## Status
Currently just the project structure (manifest, popup, content scripts, common logic, assets).  
Implementation will follow step by step.

## Planned Features
- Password strength checking (entropy-based)
- Secure password generator
- Popup interface
- Inline strength feedback near password fields
